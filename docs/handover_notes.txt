Hello there,

Thank you for picking up ColorCraft!

This project started as a personal journey — I wanted to build something beautiful and helpful for small brands, even though I had zero coding experience at the time. ColorCraft became my way to learn, grow, and prove to myself that you can start from nothing and still create something real.

This MVP helps brands discover meaningful, personality-aligned color palettes using AI. It was built with a clean backend (Node.js + Express) and a lightweight React frontend. Everything is structured for clarity and ease of use, especially for solo developers or small teams.

You're receiving:
- The full frontend and backend source code
- A working, tested MVP
- A clean docs folder with the README, logo, folder structure, and this note

My hope is that you’ll take ColorCraft further — whether that's scaling it, redesigning it, or using it as a foundation for something new. I’m cheering for you all the way.

With all my best,
Tesser
