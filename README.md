🌈 ColorCraft — An AI Tool That Helps Small Brands Find Their Ideal Color Palette

Hi! I’m the original creator of ColorCraft, a smart and lightweight MVP built to help small brands discover their perfect brand colors using AI.

I built it from the ground up — starting from zero coding experience — as a passion project to make brand identity design more approachable and fun for new businesses. It’s simple, effective, and already live as a working MVP, complete with backend, frontend, and onboarding documentation.

🚀 Why I’m Handing It Off

While I deeply love ColorCraft, I’ve decided to focus my time and energy on other high-priority projects that align even more closely with my long-term vision.

That said, ColorCraft still feels like my baby — and I don’t want to abandon it. Instead, I’d love to hand it over to the right person or team who can give it the attention and creativity it deserves.

🔍 Who I'm Looking For

I’m looking for someone with more passion, creativity, and technical vision than I have — someone who sees potential in ColorCraft not just as it is, but in what it could become.

Maybe you’ll evolve it into a full AI brand identity platform.  
Maybe you’ll blend it with your own product or portfolio.  
Maybe you’ll take it in a direction I could’ve never imagined.

Whatever it becomes, I’d love to see it grow in the hands of someone who believes in it.

📦 What’s Included

- ✅ Live working MVP (React + Node.js)
- ✅ Clean folder structure and clear documentation
- ✅ One-click local reactivation instructions
- ✅ GitHub repo: https://github.com/tesserchoi/colorcraft_v0.1.0
- ✅ Brand logo and name included

If this sparks your interest, I’d love to talk.  
ColorCraft deserves its next chapter — and maybe you’re the one to write it.

🖤  
— Tesser
